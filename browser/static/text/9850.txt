Potsdam 2 may [1752] a Dear s r , There is the bill of fare 1 of the german tar, who carried to you by sea all my tattle about Lewis the fourteenth or the great. I hope the bale countaining my tales, is safely come to London. Tho’ j recommend them to y r kindness, yet, my dear s r j would not have you to take too much trouble about them. Do what you please: and j am satisfy'd. I have read in y r new's papers a very curious banter about the death of our holy saviour. Methinks y r gazetteers make pretty free with god and with the king. If y r government is full as wise as the censurers are now and then witty, the b english must be the most happy nation in the world. For my part j use kings and gods with more reverence in the little history that goes over to you, and whose fortune j commit to y r benevolence. Permettez moy de présenter mes respects à mylady, et de souhaitter à vos enfans qu'ils soient dignes de vous et d'elle. Adio mio caro e stimatissimo amico. Volt.
