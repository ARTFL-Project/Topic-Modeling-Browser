Paris 18 th april n. s. 1729 Madam, Tho J am out of London, the favours y r ladiship has honoured me with, are not, nor will ever be out of my memory. J'll remember as long as j live, that the most respectable lady who waits, and is a friend, of the most truly great queen in the world, has vouschafed to protect me and receive me with kindness while j was at London. J am just now arrived at Paris, and j pay my respects to y r court, before j see our own. J wish for the honour of Versailles, and for the improvement of virtue and letters we could have here some Ladyes like you. You see my wishes are unbounded: so is the respect and the gratitude j am with madam y r most humble obed. servant Voltaire
