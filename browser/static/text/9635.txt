16 décembre 1746 Vous verrez par l'écrou ci-joint que Travenol père fut arrêté par votre ordonnance, . . . — which, they claim, can be withdrawn only on complaint and information. You did me the honour to tell me today that Travenol père was arrested by order of the king. This will not prevent a conseiller du parlement from exaggerating the importance of this detention, as I have been assured. This is the matter in which I ask for you orders, which seem to me very necessary.
