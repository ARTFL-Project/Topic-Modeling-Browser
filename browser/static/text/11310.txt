Editorial comment — M. de Voltaire sent him a copy of the Orphelin de la Chine , which he has no doubt printed. They would like to know whether he made the correction which was sent to him. Instead of the line aux Délices , près de Genève 27 septembre 1755 . . . Dans un cœur qui m'aima, dans un cœur que j'adore, [he should print this one:] Dans un cœur né pour moi, dans un cœur que j'adore 1 . [M. de Voltaire will be writing to him as soon as his illnesses permit him to do so. . . . He sends further corrections for the Orphelin.]
