à Ferney par Geneve 5 august 1761 Mylord, Give me leave to apply from the foot of the alps to the english noble man whose wit is the most adapted to the taste of every nation. J have in my old age a sort of conformity with you. T'is not in point of wit, but in point of ears. Mine are much hard too. The consolation of deaf people is to read, and some times to scrible. J have a a a scribler, made a prety curious commentary on many tragedies of Corneille. T'is my duty since the gran daughter of Corneille is in my house. If there was a gran daugter of Shakespear, j would subscribe for her. J hope those who take Pontichéri will take subscriptions too 1 . The work is prodigiously cheap, and no money is to be given but at the reception of the book. Nurse 2 receives the names of the subscribers. Y r name will be the most honourable and the dearest to me. J wish y r lordship long life, good eyes and good stomak. Mylord souvenez vous de votre ancien serviteur Voltaire qui vous est attaché comme s'il était né à Londres.
