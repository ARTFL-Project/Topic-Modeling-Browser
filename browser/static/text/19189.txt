h 1728] b S r , J sent the other day a cargo of french dullness to mylord Lieutenant 1 . Mylady Bollingbrooke has taken upon herself to send you one copy of the Henriade 2 . She is desirous to do that honour to my book, and j hope the merit of being presented to you by her hands will be a commendation to it. However if she has not done it already, j desire you to take one out of the cargo which is now at mylord Lieutenant. J wish you a good hearing, if you have got it, you want nothing. J have not seen m r Pope this winter, but j have seen the third volume of the miscelanea 3 , et the more j read y r works, the more j am ashamed of mines. J am with respect, esteem, and gratitude S r y r most humble obed. serv. Voltaire
