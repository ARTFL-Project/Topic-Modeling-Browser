ch√¢teau de Ferney , 29 avril Editorial comment : M. Dupuits, cornet in the colonel's company of dragoons, whom you kindly promised your favour and protection, has just heard that the 60th company is being mustered. If this news be true I join him in asking you to favour him. He is now at Dijon pursuing a lawsuit. I ask only for your protection, but I take the liberty of sending you the enclosed documents in case you think it necessary to show them to the duchesse de Grammont.
