Potsdam 27 july n. s. [1751] b Dear s r , Fortune that hurries us to and fro in this transient world, attach'd you to a great prince, and carried me to the court of a great king, but in these various tossings my head will never prove giddy enough to forget y r friendship. J hope you preserve some kindness for me, and j dare rely upon y r good heart. J must tell you j have writ an history of Lewis the fourteenth . You may presume it is writ with truth and not without liberty. J have been oblig'd to print it in Berlin at my own expense. J do presume four or five hundred copies could well sell off in y r country. The two things j have at heart, truth and liberty, being still dear to y r countrymen raise in me that expectation. J dare apply dear s r to y r kindness and old friendshipp. You may perhaps recommend the buziness to some honest man, and even to a book seller wo would be honest to merit y r favour. J would direct to him the cargoe, and he should take a reasonable salary. Jf i can by y r favour find any such man, j'll be most oblig'd to you. J hope you are an happy husband, and happy father, as you are a worthy englishman. Y r welfare shall allwais concern me, and j am for ever Dear s r , y r most faithfull friend and obedient friend Voltaire
