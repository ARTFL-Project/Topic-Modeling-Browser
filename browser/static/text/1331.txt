à Cirey ce 14 aoust [1738] J thank you my dear Tiriot for all the cares you take upon you, and more for y r good resolution omittere mirari beatæ fumum et opes strepitum que Romæ 1 , and to come to Cirey, where you will see a goddess who deserves well y r hommages, and a friend worthy of y r heart. That famous m r Saunderson 2 is, j a think, the blind man who understands so well the theory of colours. T'is one of the prodigies which England bears every day. Pray subscribe for me, to his book, for the royal paper, and let my name be counted amongst the happy readers of his productions. Be so kind as to convey to me the works 3 of Cotes and Smith as quickly as possible. J have read already all the chapters upon the tides that m r Turner b- and m r Bremond -b have suggested to you, for j have by me the philosophical transactions. But j am not satisfied with these little treatises, the question is not treated fully enough. We want the great Halley's new observations 4 . If m r Turner would be so kind as to procure me some thing new about that part of natural philosophy j would be much obliged to him. c Tell m r Turner he should come to Cirey before he returns d to England, for Cirey is a province of England. M r Turner should come in to Cireyshire . Farewell my dear Tiriot. Moussinot will give all the money necessary, to get our english books. Mylady Emily Neuton sends her services to you. Il y a un diable d'Anglais qui a fait une très belle traduction du saint Alcoran, précédée d'une préface baucoup plus belle que e tous les alcorans du monde 5 . M r Turner devroit vous dire quel est cet honnête crétien là, jl m'a fait l'honneur de m'envoyer son œuvre. Je voudrois bien luy faire présent de mon petit chétif neutonism. Adieu mon cher père Mersenne, Mersenne des agréments, et des choses essentielles, quand vous embrasserai-je donc?
