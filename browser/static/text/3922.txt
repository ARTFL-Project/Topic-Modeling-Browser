[ Ch√¢teau de Ferney , near Geneva, 28 b May 1766 I take advantage of the presence of reliable letter-carriers, your countrymen, to tell you that I have had read to me count Nolini's little poem 1 , and the others that follow it, which you did me the honour of sending me. I found some charming and original passages in these agreeable heroico-comic pieces. Allow me to tell you quite simply that in such matters the men of Friuli need not envy the Seine and the Thames their Boileau and their Pope.]
