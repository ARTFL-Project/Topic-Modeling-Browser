My good friend, I thank you heartily for the book 1 you have been pleased to favour me with. I am extreamly sensible of y r Kindness, and I own I have not received without vanity these marks of y r remembrance. I have read out the whole book. Your mind and mine do not deal in insincerity. Therefore I must tell you plainly that the doctor's sagacity has pleased me more than convinc'd. I admire his acute genius, without assenting to him, and will profess myself one of his admirers but not of his disciples. In short good s r I believe in God not in priests. It appears too plainly this is a party book rather than a relligious book. The doctor endeavours to draw his lectors to him, rather than to relligion. In many places he is more captious and acute than solid. I have known the man 2 . He is certainly a learned philosopher, and delicat wit. I thank you extreamly again for y r present and I do remain for ever y r true friend Voltaire
