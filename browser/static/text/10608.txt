Colmar in Alzace 23 x bre [1753] a The french post-masters my dear friend have convey'd to my hands with the utmost care and fidelity the tender testimonies of y r generous soul. J thank you from the bottom of my heart, and would present you my thanks my self if j was able to travel. J am not unfortunate for having fled from one who could debase himself so far as to turn a pamphleteer against me, and to employ in so scurrilous a manner his pen that j had cut, and his wit that j had form'd. He prov'd a disciple ungratefull to his master, and that's all . But the base and cruel way after which he us'd a woman more valuable for her virtue than he is for his rank, is an event worthy of the times of Attila. J have nothing to do than to forget his false friendship, and his perversity. T'is pity that one of so free a mind as j am can not live in a free country, and that one who loves you so tenderly can not enjoy y r conversation! J have enough b to live upon; but j am not healthy and strong enough, and my body does me more harm than my soul c . They have printed lately at the Hague and d old manuscript of mine which they have intitled universal history. It is very far from being such, and besides it is full of faults and omissions. The sense is every where altered. However that rhapsody is read with some pleasure, as the report is. J have perform'd an other work more accurate and more usefull. It goes e under the name of the annals of the empire. The method is clear and easy. All the events are reduc'd into a narrow compass, year by year. J think such a method to be the most proper to inculcate history in the mind of young men. J would know how j could send you some exemplari's by the way of Holland. Pray, tell me to whom j must apply to dispatch you these little tokens of my tender gratitude. Live happy my dear friend with y r respectable wife; and may y r children be worthy of their father. J am y rs for ever. V.
