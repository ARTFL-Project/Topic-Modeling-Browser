Milan , Octobr. 2nd, 1763 Dear Nuneham, It was my full intention to write to you from Geneva, but I was so much hurried during my short stay there that I really had not time. I cannot however resist making you envy me by telling you now that I pass'd a whole day with y e great Voltaire, & had y e luck to find him in very good humour. We went to dine with him at his country house, from which y e view is really very fine, but he has y e rage of wishing to lay out every thing in y e English taste, & fancies that all he has done there is so. I accordingly, when he shew'd us his place, admired everything extremely, & took notice at every allé, parterre, & bosquet I came to, how perfectly English it was. He, in return, shew'd away as much as he could, & was very entertaining. We had Martinelli 1 , whom you saw at Wimbledon, with us, & with whom he was much pleas'd, but as in some books that he has publish'd he has wrote against Voltaire, we were oblig'd to conceal his name & call'd him M r Pandini. Voltaire I believe did not discover y e truth, but found out there was some mystery, & was sometimes very ridiculous about it….
