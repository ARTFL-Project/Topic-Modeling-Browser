Paris 8 Sept. n. s. [1746] a My ever honourable and dear friend, are you my friend enough to excuse the Liberty j take? nay, to approve of it, and to do the good action j propose to y r noble heart? The marquis d'Eguille is really in very good company if he enjoys y r , but as j suppose you have not much time to spare with him, j guess he wants some sort of comfort. J dare intreat you earnestly to interpose y r good offices to obtain him the liberty to make a little journey to France. J whish j could in the mean come over to you and be his ostage. J long to visit England again and my dearest s r Evrard Falkener. Since j run upon you for favours be so kind as to send me the best printed m√©moirs upon the late insurrection in Scotland and the glorious exploits of y r Duke, with the life of Lord Lovat 1 . You can easily order all this to be directed to Rotterdam at m r Paillaret, merchant over against the exchange. He has sure means to send'em safely. Paillaret is a diminutivo of paillard, and paillard is a noble name. It signifies whoremaster, would to god j could be worthy of such a title, but sure j deserve that of y r sincere, and true friend.
