Editorial comment — Her uncle was determined to print the Orphelin de la Chine without taking Argental's remarks into account. She pointed out in vain defects in the last scene of the fourth act. He refused to put a hand to it, saying that he wanted the play to be printed as he had written it. Les Délices , 17 septembre 1755 . . . Je n'ai jamais vu mon oncle si indifférent et en même temps si entier que dans cette occasion.
