[ Lausanne , 19 September 1777 Sir, There was a time when you generously had the goodness to favour me with some of your immortal works; unfortunately I have been deprived of it for a good many years. No one knows better than you, sir, that when comedians perceive that their receipts are diminishing, they immediately announce the performance of one of your pieces. I am very nearly in the same position, and I notice too perceptibly that the orders for books which I used to receive from abroad are diminishing also. Almost all the letters of my correspondents contain these words: How you any new things of m. de Voltaire ? I reply, having no better answer, that when one has composed fifty volumes, as you have, sir, which are destined to enlighten mankind, one reposes for a time on his laurels; but they are not satisfied with this reason. You have always acted, sir, for the general welfare of humanity. I have pressing need, even more than others, to take a slight share in this distribution. I have been assured that you have a new theatrical piece in your portfolio; might I not venture to beseech you to confide the printing of it to me, or of anything that will please you? I am, with the most sincere admiration and very distinguished and respectful consideration, sir, your very humble and very obedient and faithful servant, F. Grasset, Bookseller and printer at Lausanne.]
