in London , Maiden lane 1 14 [25 n. s.] december [1727] , at the White perruke, Coventgarden Sir, You will be surprised in receiving b- an English -b essay from a french traveller 2 . Pray, forgive an admirer of you, who ows to y r writings, the love he bears to y r language, which has betray'd him into the rash attempt of writing in english. You will see by the advertisement that j have some designs c upon you 3 , and that j must mention you for the honour of y r country, and for the improvement of mine. Do not forbid me to grace my relation with y r name. Let me indulge the satisfaction of talking of you as posterity will do. In the mean time can j make bold to intreat you to make some use of y r interest in Ireland, about some subscriptions for the Henriade, which is almost ready and does not come out yet for want of little help 4 . The subscriptions will be but one guinea in hand. J am with the highest esteem, and the utmost gratitude Sir y r most humble and most obedient servant Voltaire
