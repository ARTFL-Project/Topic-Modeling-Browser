Monriond près de Lausanne 2 janvier 1756 Editorial comment : He sorrows with Lambert at the death of his wife 1 , and he who is writing for him shares his feelings. This world is not a garden of roses. He has found no better health at Monriond than at the Délices. He must suspend all work for some time. . . . The public is overloaded with bad editions of his works, full of the printers’ mistakes and his own. The wretched abortion of the war of 1741 recently published under his name must still be causing disgust. . . . He will profit from any respite given to him by his illnesses to try to render his works less unworthy of the public. . . .
