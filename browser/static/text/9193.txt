in Maiden lane at the white wigg Covent garden [c. 1 January 1728] My Lord, Tho j am a traveller unknown to y r Lordship, the name of Harlay has been for many centuries, so glorious among us french, and the branch of y r house, settled in France, is so proud of the honour of being nearly related to y r 1 that you must forgive the liberty of this letter. J have written, and printed here a book called the Henriade in which one Harlay 2 of y r house acts the most noble part, and such a one, as you should be acquainted with. For my part having been in some measure educated in the house of the late Achilles de Harlay 3 the oracle and the first president of our parliament, j should be wanting to my duty if j durst not trouble y r lordship, about it, and beg of the favour of waiting upon you before the book comes out 4 . J expect to know when j may wait upon your lordship. J am with much respect mylord y r Lordship's most humble most obedient faithfull servant Voltaire
