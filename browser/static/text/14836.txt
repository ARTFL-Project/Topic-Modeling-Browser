b Sir, I think myself greatly honour'd by a paragraph in a letter which you were pleas'd some time ago to write to M r Camp at Lyons and had it been in my power to have follow'd my inclinations, I should have paid my respects at Ferney long before this time, but a violent bilious fever most unluckily seiz'd me upon the road & confin'd me to my bed five weeks at Munich & now my affairs are so circumstanc'd that I am oblig'd to go to Paris as expeditiously as my present weak state of health will permit me. You were pleas'd to tell a Gentleman that you had a theatre ready to receive me; I should with great pleasure have exerted what little talents I have, & could I have been the means of bringing our Shakespeare into some favour with M r Voltaire I should have been happy indeed! No enthusiastick Missionary who had converted the Emperor of China to his religion would have been prouder than I, could I have reconcil'd the first Genius of Europe to our Dramatic faith. I am Sr Your most humble & most Obedient servant David Garrick PS. Tho I have call'd Shakespeare our dramatick faith yet I must do my countrymen y e Justice to declare, that notwithstanding their deserv'd admiration of his astonishing Powers they are not bigotted to his errors, as some french Journalists have so confidently affirm'd.
