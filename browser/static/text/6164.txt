[? January 1732] a Sir, I took lately the liberty to send you the History , or rather an Essay on the history of king Charles the twelfth . Now I beg leave to make you a better present. M. Tiriot, who will render you this, is a friend of mine who travels for his pleasure, and learns English for his instruction. I have so often spoken to him of all the favours you honoured me with, that I could not forbear charging him with the thanks I must return to your kindness. I will never let slip an opportunity of making you sensible of my gratitude, not only to you but to England; and I cannot better express my love to your country, than by procuring to my friend the honour of your acquaintance; for travellers judge of a country by the men they have seen: and certainly, by that highest esteem wich I profess for the English nation, one may easily perceive I had the honour once to enjoy m r Dodington's conversation. I am, with respect and gratitude, sir, Your most humble and obedient faithful servant, Voltaire
