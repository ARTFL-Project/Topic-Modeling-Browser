Ferney , Thursday, May 9th, 1771 The old man of Ferney, grown nearly blind, and overwhelmed with infirmities, would have hastened to throw himself at the feet of the princess Daschkaw, had not his sad state of health prevented him. If the princess would come to-morrow (Friday), about seven o'clock in the evening, to honour us with her presence, and sup in our cottage along with her party, madame Denis will do the honours of it, and the old invalid will consider this favour as one of the bright days of his life. He entreats permission to remain en robe de chambre , being a long time unable to dress otherwise. He begs the princess to accept his respectful homage.
