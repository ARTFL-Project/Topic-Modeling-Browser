Editorial comment â€” She has not written to him since the conversation 1 she had with m. de Malesherbes the day before leaving. She had gone to see him at Clichy on receiving a letter from her uncle. The latter had not sent m. de Malesherbes the third volume of the Histoire universelle in order to have it printed, but in order to consult him. . . . This was not, certainly, because Voltaire is not pleased to have Lambert print his works, but because he had given his word to Chofling that he would not give this book to anyone until he (Schoepflin) had sold his edition. . . . Her uncle wished her to ask whether Lambert has begun the Henriade , and begs him to send a sheet as soon as it is available. . . . 19 juillet [1754] Mignot Denis
