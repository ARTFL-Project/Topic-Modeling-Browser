Potsdam 28 nov bre 1752 b J hope my dear and worthy friend, my worthy englishman, you have receiv'd mylord Bolinbrok's vindication 1 against priests whom j have hated, j hate, and j shall hate till doomsday, if there is a day of doom. You will receive dear s r in a very short time an exemplary of Louis 14â€™ new edition, more accurate, great deale more copious and curious. J desire you would be so kind as to answer two letters j wrote to you long ago; let me not be altogether in the dark about the good or bad success of my book in England. Ten editions of it have been publish'd this year in Europe, and two new ones come out just now. But y r approbation would c flatter me more than that egerness of the bookmongers. Tully rely'd more on the testimony of Cato than on the huzaz d of the multitude. If you have any news of my book's fate, let me know something of it after a whole year. If you have given the volumes to a bookseller, be so good as to tell me wether this bookseller has any thing to remitt or not. It is very likely j shall take e a little journey, suppose my bad health will permitt. Would to god! my journey was to London, and that j could renew to you my tender respect, my friendship and my gratitude. J sent you according to y r orders a list of the best French authors, and more suitable to y r caracter, but you will find a better one at the end of the new edition of Lewis the fourteenth. Vale! V.
