S r , J hear Prevost hath a mind to bring you a second time as an evidence against me. He sais, j have told you, j had a given him five b and twenty books for thirty guineas. J remember very well s r j told you at c Rainbow's d coffee house 2 that e j had given him twenty subscription receipts for the Henriade, and received thirty guineas down. But j never meant to have parted with thirty copies at three guineas each for thirtyone pounds. J have agreed with him upon quite another foot, and j am not such a fool (tho a writer) to give away all my property to a bookseller. Therefore j desire you to remember that j never told you of my having made so silly a bargain. J told j own, j had thirty pounds or some equivalent, down, but j did not say, t'was all the bargain. This j insist upon, and beseech you to recollect our conversation, for j am sure j never told a tale so contrary to truth, to reason, or to my interest. J hope you will not back the injustice of a bookseller who abuses you against a man of honour who is y r most humb[le] f servant Voltaire g J beseech you to send me an answer to my lodging without any delay. J shall be extreemly obliged to you. h
