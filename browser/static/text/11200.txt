Paris the 15th of novem b n. s. [1749] a Dear s r , J had the honour to see, but for too little a time, the worthy son of y r great chancellor 1 . He seems to me a gentleman of much wit without any kind of affectation; learned yet having a good taste, and of a very amiable caracter. J send you my dear friend the two first exemplaries of Semiramis 2 just coming from the press. J have not sent yet any one to the cardinal Querini, to whom the work is dedicated. But j pray you to give one to y r friend m r Yorke who seems to be as good a judge of these matters as the whole sacred college. Y r for ever Voltaire
