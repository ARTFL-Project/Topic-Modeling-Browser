st [1753] b Dear s r , J have writ to you already 1 , and sent my letter to s r Hambury Williams, the british envoy at the court of Dresden; j told you in that letter all that j could tell concerning my little quarrel with the king of Prussia, but j could not tell enough about the desire j have to see again England before my death. J did inform you of my desire to print my works in London, without benefit, without subscription, and merely in order to give a true edition of the works of a frenchman who thinks like a briton. I send this letter to Dresde; j must c tell you j have taken the liberty to draw upon you the 94 pounds. J return you again 94 thousand thanks. J do not know how long again j will continue at Berlin, but what will ever happen, j'll remain for everd y r faithfull and much obliged friend. V.
