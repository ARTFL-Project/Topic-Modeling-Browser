. . . M. le comte Contenot is neither as proud nor as happy as Gros Chat. Your friendship and the hope of seeing you soon has almost entirely restored my health and strength, and I flatter myself I shall have the honour to resemble Samson on your arrival. But while working all these miracles on your old friend, the contrary will happen if you deceive my hopes. Do you suppose a very tender mistress has less desire to see her lover again? I have not forgotten that it is more than five years since I saw you, and I tremble lest some obstacle should stop you on the road. All the petites femmes entreat you, and would like to see the building commenced to which they will go to receive your blessing; but I am sure that it will not be the flattering letters of a certain prince which will prevent this project at present. I return thanks to god every day for having made me nothing more than a Gros Chat, and for having learned in your works how to think. It is to you that I owe the first movements of friendship and gratitude, and I shall be still more in your debt if it is true that I shall have the honour to see you the architect of the de Champbonins, as you have been of my sentiments. . . . I have not been able to await your reply to my last letter, because it seemed to me that I had too feebly indicated my longing to see you, but it is quite certain that you cannot doubt it, nor leave quickly enough to arrive at our colony. I wrote to you that you would find a suitable apartment, either upstairs or down; but tell me promptly at what time you hope to come. We occupy ourselves only with you, and we shall be still more occupied with the desire to please and convince you of the entire attachment of the petites femmes . . . .
