Mylord, J hope j shall not have the misfortune of going out of England without having seen y r Lordship, and y r house at Chizeek 1 . As j am the admirer of y r architecture, j dare intreat y r Lordship to be the encourager of my book. You saw last year those cuts which adorn the Henriade , and which being wrought by the best masters in Europe, are not unworthy a of being presented to you. Therefore j expect you'll vouchsafe to put y r name in the list 2 there inclosed. Be so kind as to send the b list back by one of y r servants, and to excuse the liberty j take. J am with much respect Mylord y r Lordship's most humble and most obedient servant Voltaire Maidenlane at the white wigg Covent garden [c. 1 January 1728] c
