S r , I some time since receiv'd the honour of an English Couplet 1 from you in return for my Translation of your Tragedy of Les Scythes . Be assur'd that I shall ever esteem such a Mark of your good opinion b to me as a more valuable Relict than any that either your Country c 2 or France could d produce. There has lately appear'd here two authentic Volumes of Letters 3 by the late Earl of Chesterfield in which some outlines of your Character are faithfully delineated.
