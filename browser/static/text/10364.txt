St. James's square, September 4, 1761 The pressure of business is but a feeble reason for having deferred answering the honour of a letter from M. de Voltaire, and on so interesting a subject.

I feel the high value of the favourable sentiments you are so good as to express on my subject, and am happy in this occasion of assuring you of the distinguished consideration with which I have the honour to be, &c. W. Pitt
