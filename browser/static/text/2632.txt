No.xxxv, 12/23 September 1760 , at Geneva ] [My lord, I inquired of the author whether he permitted m. Kramer to send 4000 copies of the History of Peter the great abroad to Paris. He answered that he is not in a position to give orders to m. Kramer, who had done it on his own initiative, out of apprehension that the book might be published elsewhere, and this despite repeated assurances that any losses incurred by Kramer would be repaid. I did not feel it necessary to address any reproaches to m. Voltaire or even to the publisher, because the thing has already been done, and I do not yet know whether your excellency will find in this affair anything requiring correction. I confined myself to saying nothing at all, and await your instructions. The other day Alzire was performed at Tournay. The owner of the house acted the role of Alvar√®s, and his niece that of Alzire, to the applause of all the spectators. The duc de Villars, son of the celebrated marshal, was present at the spectacle. He related the ready wit of his father. When in the day before the taking of Milan the marshal was asked how old he was, he replied: 'J'aurai demain Milan'. In all he says in society m. Voltaire continues to express a fitting regard for the protector of the Russian muses. I have the honour to entrust myself to the very gracious protection of your excellency, remaining with the most sincere and the deepest respect, my lord, your very humble and very devoted servant Boris Saltikov
