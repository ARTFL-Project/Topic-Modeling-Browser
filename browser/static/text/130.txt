J Hear this moment of your sad adventure 1 . That water you fell in, was not Hippocrene's water, otherwise it would have respected you. Jndeed j am concerned beyond expression for the danger you have been in, and more for your wonds. Is it possible that those fingers which have written the rape of the lock and the Criticism, which have dressed Homer so becomingly in an english coat, should have been so barbarously treated?

J am sincerely ser with the admiration which you deserve Your most humble servant Voltaire in my lord Bolingbroke's house Friday [September/October 1726] b at noon
