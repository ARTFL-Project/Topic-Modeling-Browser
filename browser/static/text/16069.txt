J'ay toujours my dear sir des remerciments à vous faire. Voicy la première fois qu'on a réduit un imprimé en manuscrit 1 pour l'envoyer par la poste. Y r manuscrit testifies that a great emperess was a whore. As to the barbarien and barbarous law-giver Peter the great, he was much superior to Moses and Romulus and Theseus; at least he was born in better times. We are not born in very good times, since wise and learned nations spill more blood and squander away more money for a little corner of Acadia, than whole a Acadia shall be ever worth. Martin says the world is a sad pack of madmen. I am happy to have known a man so wise and so good naturd as you are. Such caracters attone for the ugly and covetous fierceness of others. J will not fail to send you the creation of Peter the great so soon as the book shall be printed. J am for ever with the utmost gratitude y r . . . V. aux Délices 27 b juillet [1759]
