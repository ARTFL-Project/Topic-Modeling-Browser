My dearest and most respected friend, altho j am a popish dog, much addicted to his holyness, and like to be sav'd by his pouver, yet j retain for my life something of the english in me, and j can not but make you my compliment upon the brave conduct of y r illustrious duke. You have made a rude campaign 1 in a climate, pretty different from that of Turky. You have amongst y r prisoners a french nobleman call'd the marquis d'Eguilles 2 , brother to that noble and ingenuous madman who has writ the lettres juives. The marquis is possess'd of as much with as his brother, and is a little wiser. J think no body deserves more y r attention, j dare say y r kindness. I recommend him to you from my heart. My dear Fawkenear is renoun'd in France, for many virtues, and dear to me for many benefits. Let him do me these new favour, jll be attach'd to him tenderly for all my life. Farewell my dear friend. Let all men be friends; let peace reign over all Europe. Voltaire Paris 13 june 1746 b
