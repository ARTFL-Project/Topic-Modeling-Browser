Sir, I hear that when you take our settlements, you take subscriptions 1 too. Corneille belongs to every nation, and especially to those who greatly think, and bravely die 2 : had Shakespeare left a grand-daughter, I would subscribe for her. Give me leave to thank you for what you do in favour of Corneille's blood. I am, with respect, Sir, Your most humble obedient servant, Voltaire
