aux Délices 8 juillet 1762 Dear s r , Had lady Grey writ in her days in the manner she writes after her death, all England would have rais'd in her favour against that pious murderess queen Mary. J hope you will be secretary to all the english queens. They shall become with the help of y r pen, the darling of the nation. J thank you heartily for that charming copy of verse 1 . J had the honour to see thirty years ago the lady y r epistle inscrib'd too. She has pass'd from the throne of beauty, to that of wit. If she remembers me, j pray you to present her with my humble respect. Rank me good s r amongst y r admirers and faithfull friends. Voltaire On imprime Pierre Corneille avec les commentaires. Cet auteur a de grands défauts et de grandes beautez, mais il est moins fou que votre Shakespear parce qu'il vivait dans un siècle plus sage.
