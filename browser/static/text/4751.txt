Berlin 16 january [1753] b Dear s r , I have reap'd benefit enough, since j have pleas'd you, and not displeas'd y r nation. J do return you the most tender thanks. J hope to come over my self in order to print my true works, and to be buried in the land of freedom. J require no subscription, j desire no benefit, If my works are neatly printed and cheaply sold, j am satisfye'd. You must know that a dispute upon a point of mathematics hath rais'd a scandalous noise between one Maupertuis, president of the prussian academy, and the professor Kœnig. All the philosofers of Europe were for Kœnig, and all the world cry'd out against the ill usage he receiv'd from Maupertuis. But the king of Prussia took the part of the president, and wrote against Kœnig's abettors a pamphlet, wherein his majesty calls them Rogues, scurillous and infamous writers, half wiked and madmen. In the mean time Maupertuis gave out a singular book of philosofy. The author proposes to build a latin town; to lengthen out human life to four hundred years, by laying men asleep; to go to the c antartik pole, and there to dissect the brain of giants in order to know the nature of the soul, etc. The book is full of such nonsense: but the author had the good sense to calumniate me to the king. His majesty one day according to his good will and pleasure, order'd at his break fast that his own hang man should burn a little banter j had writ upon the noble discoverings of Maupertuis. The rest of the story is contain'd in the little paper 1 j send you, which j intreat you to make appear in all y r news papers. If j live, if j am free, i'll cross the sea to thank you. Y r for ever. J pray you to keep my letter secret.
