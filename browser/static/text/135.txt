from London July 3 d 1772 Sir, I take the liberty of sending you a little book 1 lately published by me; it contains besides a great deal of nonsense, two very pretty prints engraved by the Celebrated Bartolozzi; which prints, and the View with which the book was published are its only recommendation. The taste of Gardening, as it seems to me is, very indifferent all over Europe: a wish to see it mended, has induced me to th[r]ow out a few hints upon that subject; hopeful that they might excite others to labour in the same field; so ample, so rich, and so well deserving the Attention of Genius: â€™tis much to be regreted that Monsieur de Voltaire, amidst the great variety of Subjects he has so successfully treated, has never employed his thoughts upon this. I have the honour to be with great respect Sir Your most Obedient humble serv. W. Chambers
