[28 April 1761] a S r , Y r son is an English lad, and j an old french man. He is healthy, and j am sick, jet j love him with all my heart, not only for his father, but for himself. We are very free together, he does me the honour to come to my little cabane when he pleases; we are to dine just now and to drink your health. 'Tis for me a good fortune to receive the son of the amiable and honour'd m r Fox who was formerly so kind to me; if j were but sixty years old, j would come again to England, but j will live here and dye with the utmost respect, Monsieur, Votre très humble et très obéissant serviteur Voltaire
