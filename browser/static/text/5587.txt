[ Geneva , 10 August 1763 Sir, I shall always be delighted to execute the commissions you give me. It was only necessary to interest yourself in the bookseller Grasset to make me neglect nothing on the subject. I had the honour of speaking about him, as you wished, to m. de Voltaire, and I was enchanted with the extremely kind manner with which he listened to my request. He assured me that he would beg m. Freudenreich, his friend, to write to the reigning advoyer to ask permission for Grasset to be allowed the exercise of his trade at Lausanne. Thus, dear sir, I hope that this affair will meet with no difficulties.]
