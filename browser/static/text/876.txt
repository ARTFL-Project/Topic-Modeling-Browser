Editorial comment : It seems probable that most of Voltaire's surviving letters to Cramer, varying in length from a couple of lines to several pages, have now been recovered; most of these very numerous letters are wholly or partly undated, but a high proportion of them has now been dated more or less precisely; yet a hard core of unplaceable letters remains, and many of these have been assembled here in a more or less central position. It should be noted that in this context circa has a wide latitude, and that these letters cannot be printed chronologically. To underline this fact they have been arranged in the rigid alphabetical sequence of the incipits, except that the first word of each one has been listed as if modernised and expanded. Monsieur Gabriel is requested to remember that his clowns of printers make enough mistakes to cause a poor devil of an author to die of pain . . . .
