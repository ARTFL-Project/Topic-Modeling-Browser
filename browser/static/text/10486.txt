Sir, It is long since I had the pleasure to converse with you, personally; but your true self has been nearer, and I enjoy so frequent an intimacy with your mind, in those generous transcripts of it, which the world is possess'd of, that I don't know, whether I can say, with propriety, you have been absent . As I greatly esteem your genius , I must be ambitious of your judgment ; therefore, hope, you will justify my partiality, who prefer this tragedy of Zaire , to all the rest of mr Voltaire's writings: some of which had impress'd me, with too slight an opinion of his capacity. In a month, or two, I shall bring Zara on the stage; where, as she is neither dumb enough to forbear speaking at all, nor brisk enough to talk smuttily , I am afraid, the example of her success on the French theatre, will hardly entitle her to a civil reception, good taste , being the last of their fashions , we shall be fond of appearing in. If, after having read it yourself, you find it fit to be read by, or to such of your friends, as can promote its success, by their influence, I flatter myself you will do it that favour. And, if I might be particular, in tasking your indulgence, mr Dodington should be the first to the number. I have not enough the honour of his acquaintance to sollicit his concern for support of this tragedy; but it has been, so justly applauded at Paris, that (abating for some loss, it may have sustain'd in the translation) its ill reception at London, might bring a kind of infamy, on the nation; and mr Dodington is, too nobly, the son of his country to decline an opportunity of asserting her justice. As all my own copies are travelling, upon this errand, I take the liberty of sending you one, that my daughter had writ, for herself; and which, tho' a little wild, in the cut of the letter, is, I believe, pretty free from errors of consequence, I am Sir, yours, &c. A. Hill
