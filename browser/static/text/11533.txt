‘To pluck its honours off and sink it down To teach an awfull moral in the dust.’ 1 Y r honours, good and amiable s r , shall not be pluck't down, y r muse shall not be lai'd in the dust. ‘…allow'd a little space To shine, attract, then fade, and be forgot’ 2 etc. By all the saints of Rome, you shall not be forgot. J see in y r work Truth clad in her solemn garments. J'd rather admire Rome in y r verses than at the pope's feet. J was long depriv'd of y r poem thanks to this damnd war. At last it was convey'd to me. War ought not to be waged against muses. A word again. The description of poor Laura buriing herself in the geole of Virgin Mary 3 , is charming. Be sure dear s r no man entertains a greater esteem for you in England than j do on the borders of my lake. J am for ever y r servant, admirer and friend. Voltaire aux Délices 30 juin 1760
