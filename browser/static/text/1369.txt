Editorial comment : Reproaches his former assistant for having supposed him to be the author of the second part of Candide , but excuses him because good taste cannot be cultivated abroad. He would not have attempted to annotate Corneille had he not been within reach of his fellow-members of the Academy. Denies that he is the author of the ode on war, though he likes four stanzas. Subscriptions to the edition of Corneille should be sent to the Cramers at Geneva. He himself is now living at Ferney, where he has built a theatre and a church.
