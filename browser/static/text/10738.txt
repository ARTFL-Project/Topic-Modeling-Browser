Paris , May 29, 1726 Dear Sir, Mr Voltaire, a French poet, who has wrote several pieces with great success here, being gone for England in order to print by subscription an excellent poem 2 , called Henry IV , which, on account of some bold strokes in it against persecution and the priests, cannot be printed here; m. de Morville 3 , the Mec√¶nas, or, I may truly say, the Dodington here, for the encouragement of wit and learning, has earnestly recommended it to me to use my credit and interest for promoting this subscription among my friends; on which account, as well as for the sake of merit, I thought I could apply myself no where more properly than to you; and I hope this will answer the particular view and interest which I have in it myself, which is, to renew a correspondence so agreeable to me; who am with the greatest truth and affection, sir, Your most obedient and most humble servant, H. Walpole
