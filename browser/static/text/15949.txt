My dear Sir, You cannot imagine how Exactly we agree in our sentiments of the Duke de Foix 1 : Your Letter is a very agreeable Critique upon y e Performance, & might make a very good Letter in y r Magazine 2 : I shall preserve it with y e hopes that You'll do something with it, I have sent You y e Orphan of China 3 , which you may keep, if y e other does not arrive, if it does, keep it for me. Y r Notion of Dialogue is y e truth, & what You must practise hereafter. Put it in practice when you attack y e Orphan. If you have anything to communicate & sh d come this way, I shall be at home till Nine, & drink Tea at six, but I don't desire to see you, unless you have Nothing Else to do. Y r Confidence in me will not (I flatter myself) be disappointed, I am sure You take my open plain friendly dealing with you, as it is meant. Y rs Dear Sir most faithfully PS. is M rs Hawkesworth in Town? Pray M rs Garrick's & my best compliments to her. I shall be in Town next Thursday. I shall expect a Line from You with y r opinion &c. D: Garrick
