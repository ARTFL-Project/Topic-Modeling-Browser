Geneva , 3 December 1758 I have passed many years in compiling an epitome on religion. It is a honey I have abstracted from the essence of all flowers; I have made it my own special study by composing an academic discourse requiring rather less than an hour to read, which has for title ‘Le Vray’. I present myself at your door, sir, in order to refer this piece to your tribunal. You are the prince of fine geniuses, and the hero of our nation. I should render myself guilty of the crime of anarchy if I did not solicit the honour of your approbation, or at least if I did not render this feeble homage to your superiority of knowledge by praying you to grant me your criticisms. Necessity compels me to make profit out of this piece and to place it on sale. What would it not gain in price if you deign, sir, to honour it with your protection? Your servants at the door were not able to answer exactly at what moment I might present it to you; perhaps they judged ill of my dress. It is of you, sir, that I ask an audience. An accident on the road in coming here places me in straitened circumstances. I am lodging at the ‘Ecu de France’. At the precise moment I shall be at your orders. I am, sir, with the most respectful consideration, etc.
