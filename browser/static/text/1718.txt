[October 1760] Sir, I have received the Honour of your Letter dated from your Castle of Fernex in Burgundy, by which I find I was guilty of an Error in calling your Retirement an Exile . When another edition shall be made of my Dialogues, either in English or French, I will take care that this Error shall be corrected, and I am very sorry I was not apprized of it sooner, that I might have corrected it in the first edition of a French Translation of them just published under my Inspection in London. To do you Justice is a Duty I owe to Truth and myself; and you have a much better Title to it than from the Passports you say you have procured for English Noblemen: you are entitled to it, Sir, by the high sentiments of Respect I have for you, which are not paid to the Privileges you tell me your King has confirm'd to your Lands, but to the noble Talents God has given you, and the superior Rank you hold in the Republick of Letters . The Favours done you by your sovereign are an Honour to Him ; but add little Lustre to the name of Voltaire . I entirely agree with you, that God is the Father of all Mankind; and should think it Blasphemy to confine his Goodness to a sect : nor do I believe that any of his Creatures are good in his sight, if they do not extend their Benevolence to all his Creation. These Opinions I rejoice to see in your Works, and shall be very happy to be convinced that the Liberty of your Thoughts and your Pen upon subjects of Philosophy and Religion never exceeded the bounds of this generous Principle, which is authorized by Revelation as much as by Reason; or that you disapprove in your hours of sober Reflexion any irregular sallies of Fancy, which cannot be justified , tho' they may be excused , by the vivacity and Fire of a great Genius. I have the honour to be Sir Your most humble servant Lyttelton
