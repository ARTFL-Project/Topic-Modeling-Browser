Dear Madam, I congratulate all your friends & myself among that honourable happy number for your safe return to us. M rs Garrick did herself the honour of calling upon you to return her thanks in Person for the great care you have taken, & the trouble you have had, with the friendly favour of m rs Necker to her. I heard w th pleasure of y r being at the french Academy when Voltaire exhibited his malevolent Nonsense (for which too among other Obligations I thank you) upon our belov'd & immortal Shakespeare: could any thing possibly add to my Admiration of m rs Montagu it was the Expression of contempt & astonishm t which, I hear, You put on, at the hearing of the weak and impotent roarings of age, Envy, hatred & malice. It rejoices me much to hear, that this unchristian attack upon Genius had not a favourable reception Even from his own friends. I doubt not, but you have converted Numbers to the faith not w th sword as Mahomet did, but by those emanations of Genius, which you have caught from the divinity you have so powerfully, & justly protected & admir'd. This attack of Voltaire, I hope, is not to pass unnotic'd. If the Champions will not mount with the regulars, the Light horse & hussars must begin a Skirmish. I most devoutly wish for the honour of a little conversation, which I should immediately have Endeavor'd to enjoy in Hill Street, had not a small attack of y e Gout ob[liged me to] a stay at home for a day or t[wo] a . May I not hope for that, [ . . . ] a favour, as soon as the more imp[ortant] a matters have had their first dues, & with our little demands may present ourselves with all Love, & humilyty? I am D r mad m Y r most devoted serv t D. Garrick M rs Garrick presents her respects. I w d send my best wishes, with my Wife's to miss Gregory but alass, I fear the enchantements of french Everything has destroy'd all my hopes. I w d not have sent this scrawl could I have written better, but y e illbred gout has preventd me.
