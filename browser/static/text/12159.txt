[Les Délices , 27 June 1756 The best of worlds possible, my dear friend, is very sad for those who lose their children, and for those who see their sickly substance fade away. I belong to this latter category, and although suffering I sympathise tenderly with you in your losses. I do not know if mme de Brenles is as good a nurse as she is an honest woman, or if she has enough milk to nourish a Swiss. I advise her to try a robust peasant woman for her next infant. I have had at my petites Délices your friend m. Polier de Bottens, but he only slept here one night. I hope to see you again occasionally at my ease at the end of the autumn. You will find me even more ailing than you have ever seen me, but always very resigned. People who love exciting news hope that two empresses will shortly kiss the king of Prussia. These are two queens of Saba who do not pretend to consult Solomon. Lovers of liberty are not sorry for the little example which Sweden has just given to despots. I am sorry for it on account of his noble majesty Ulric, whose very respectful servant I was. Long live the sweetness of retreat! The more I indulge in it the more content I am with it. But I ought to share this retreat with you. Mme Denis sends you a thousand compliments. I salute you with all my heart, and am yours for life.] V.
