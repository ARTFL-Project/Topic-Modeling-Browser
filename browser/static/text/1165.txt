Editorial comment : He finds nothing decided in Voltaire's letters concerning his project of establishing himself at Lausanne, notwithstanding all the satisfactory things that respectable persons have written to him. M. des Gloires, 1 who is about the same age as Voltaire, has taken a wife 2 and built a house at Lausanne. Mme de Goll will inform him shortly of the new honour which m. de Brenles has received. The want of books need not prevent Voltaire coming. They exist in the library, in the collections of many private individuals, and in his own, and he can always send abroad for more.
