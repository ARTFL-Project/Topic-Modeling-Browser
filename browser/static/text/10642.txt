Geneve aux Balances ce 22 Aoust [1765] M r Wilkes presents compliments of veneration and gratitude to Monsieur de Voltaire. He humbly submits the stolen first fruits of the Geneva press 1 , in a letter wrote at a critical time, which Lord Temple return'd to M r Wilkes that it might be printed in the notes on M r Churchill's works; and in a second short letter to M r Martin, which occasion'd the other duel, in which M r Wilkes was dangerously wounded. Monsieur de Voltaire will find in the two volumes of Pope a faithfull collation of the several editions, and many imitations pointed out, which were unnotic'd by the right reverend pedant 2 . M r Wilkes begs to assure the amiable Ladies of Monsieur de Voltaire's family of his sincere respects.
