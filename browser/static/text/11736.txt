at the castle of Ferney 8 March n. st. 1764 This is my answer to the anonime letter j have receiv'd. If it is reported in a pamphlet impos'd upon me, that a minister of state under Charles the second, was a candid and good husband to two wives at once, and that he wrote a prety book on those patriarcal good manners, j know neither that pamphlet nor that statesman, but j should be very glad to peruse the pretended book writ on the plurality of wives, tho j am no way concern'd in the business of poligamy or bigamy or even monogamy. 1 Voltaire gentlemen ord r of the Kings chamber
