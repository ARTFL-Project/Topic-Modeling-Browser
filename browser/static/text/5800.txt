[c. 10 December 1757] b [J am] c much griev'd that our philosopher of Paris, [is] c at odds with my philosofer of Geneva. Since you did not offend him willfully, jll write to him he ought not take offense. Men who think like you and he, should be friends. J do not know what he hath advanc'd concerning y r fellow-priests. J am told he accuses them to believe in one god. J hope y r fellows do not believe in many gods. Ut ut est, j am their humble servant. J look upon them with a sincere esteem, and there is no damn'd papist more addicted to them than j am. J dubb you and friend Clappared, my bishops. Be quiet and love y r friend. V.
