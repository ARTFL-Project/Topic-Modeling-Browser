Paris 17 january [1746] Dear Sir, J was at Versailles, not at court, when you did me the favour to send me y r book 1 . J have receivd it at my return, and j should have come to y r house in order to present you with my most hearty thanks were j not debarr'd from this pleasure and from all the duties of life, by the deplorable state of my crazy constitution. The reading of y r letters has assuag'd for some times the continu'd tortures b nature has doom'd me to. Had j often c such cordials, j would not complain any more of my ills. J support life when j suffer, j enjoy it when j read you. J wish you had travell'd throug all the world and wrote on all nations. It becomes only a wise man to travel and to write. But our travellers, our writers, and our lectors are for the most part very far from being wise. J thank you again, and shall read you again. Y r most humble servant Voltaire
