Geneva , 15th April 1776 … And now pray don't suppose me stupid enough to have passed a day at Geneva without going to Ferney to see — you know who. Dare not mention names in case this letter should fall into certain hands, but upon the whole, in this as well as in most of my undertakings, have been remarkably fortunate, and to tell you the truth from what I have allways heard, and what I had here confirmed in regard to his shyness of seeing people, had hardly hopes of seeing any more than his house and garden. But to my great satisfaction, without giving myself or any body any trouble, met this prodigy walking in the garden alone, where, as you may be sure, not failing to pass quite near him [I] took a good phizz of him, when I found him the oldest, 82, most infirm and emaciated figure that I ever beheld, dressed in the same wig and kind of bonnet cap that we allways see him represented in, in busts, medals, prints, &c.

What is remarkable is that the house is full of busts and pictures of him. In one room I observed one statue, one picture in crayons, another in sewing , besides a bust, upon the pedestal of which was written immortalis , but modestly enough a card announced its being given him by the King of Prussia, anno 1775, of whom I also saw here an original picture sent to Voltaire….
