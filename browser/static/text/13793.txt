Editorial comment : He has received the history of the war of 1741, as falsified, as disfigured as the universal history. It is his lot to be printed very absurdly, unless Lambert one day puts things in order. He has been told that Lambert will soon receive a complete set of a very badly printed work, produced in Holland they say. What concerns him more particularly is the collection of his works. There is almost an entire volume of small new chapters, which would help the sale of the rest. But once again, time is needed for everything. He asks Lambert to await his return to Paris, and to reflect that an invalid who has a universal history to finish cannot do everything in a day. He begs him to consider his own interests, and for Voltaire's sake not to hurry.
