avril 1729 I saw last night the duke of R. 1 He begged of me so earnestly to have leave to apprize Pallu of my appearing to him like a hobgoblin, that I could not refuse. Therefore I do not think it proper to show my letter of yesterday to Pallu. Speak to him as if you did it of your own accord, and the thing will succeed as well, and better. I beg of you to desire m. Maisons, to restore the Swedish manuscript 2 . Do not forget to write to Bernard 3 . I will return, in two hours hence, to Saint-Germain. Write to me often, and love me. Remember to talk with m. Guebriant 4 when you see him.
