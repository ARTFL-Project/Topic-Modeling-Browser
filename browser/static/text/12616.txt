He assures Voltaire that he will be as free at Lausanne as in England. He gives him his word of honour as to the truth of this, and m. de Brenles offers to do the same. Voltaire might make a visit to Lausanne incognito and see for himself that he does not exaggerate, and he points out the route to take. M. Polier de Bottens has just been invested with the highest ecclesiastical position of the town; Voltaire would have in him a friend of much authority, and he can see in m. Philibert's edition what may be expected on this point. What Voltaire needs is to have his works printed under his own eyes in a neutral and free country, and by the hands of a printer who looks more to his honour than his self-interest; and Lausanne and he (Bousquet) fulfil these conditions.
