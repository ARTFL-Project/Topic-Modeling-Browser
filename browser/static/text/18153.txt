a Sir I have taken the liberty of offering my small poetical tribute 1 to the first Genius in the world. As nobody has written so well & so forcibly against the principles of intoleration, as Mons r de Voltaire, I hope he will excuse the excess of Zeal with which I have Indeavor'd to paint in this Ode the Powers of our great dramatic Poet, Shakespeare, Who is both the founder and chief supporter of the English stage. I am Sir Your most Obedient humble Servant & sincere Admirer D. Garrick
