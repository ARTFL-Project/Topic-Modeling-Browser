Editorial comment : He ardently wishes to see Voltaire at Lausanne, and will come to meet him if he wishes it. He saw yesterday major de Prélaz 1 , who did not think Voltaire would come. M. de Brenles, just made lieutenant bailiff in place of his deceased friend M. de Loÿs de Bochat 2 , would be greatly disappointed in such a case. He sends the compliments of MM. de Brenles and de Bottens. He is not sure whether Voltaire has the eight volumes of the Memoirs of the Abbé de Montgon 3 , which he prefers to the Esprit des Nations 4 , published at Geneva. He asks for information concerning a work entitled Le Théâtre de M. de Voltaire 5 published in his name, and of which he knows nothing.
