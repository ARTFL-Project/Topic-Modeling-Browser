a If j have forgot the scraps of english j had once gathered, j'll never forget my dear ambassador. J am now at Paris, and with the same she philosopher j live with these tuvelve years. Was j not so constant in my bargains for life, j would certainly come to see you in y r kiosk, in y r quiet and y r glory. You will know the new victory of my good friend the king of Prussia, who wrote so uvell against Machiavel, and acted immediately like the heroes of Machiavel. He fidles and figths as well as any man in christendom; he routs austrian forces, and loves but very little y r king, his dear neigbour of Hanover. J have seen him twice since he is free from his father's tyranny. He vould retain me at his court, and liv'd whith me in one of his country houses just with the same freedom and the same goodness of manners you did at Wanshorth b . But he could not prevail against the marquise du Chastellet. My only reason for being in France is that j am a friend. You must know my prussian king, when he was but a man, lov'd passionately y r englhish gouvernment, but the king has altered the man, and now he relishes despotik pouver, as much as a Mustapha, a Selim, or a Solyman. News came yesterday at our court the king of Sardinia 1 would not at all hearken to borbonian propositions. This shrubb will not suffer the french tree to c extend his branches over all Italy. J would be affraid of an universal war, but j hope much from the white d pate of our good cardinal, who desires peace and quiet, and will give it to christendom if he can. J have seen here our ottoman minister, Sa√ød bacha; j have drank wine with his chaplain and reason'd with Laria, his interpreter, a man of sense who knows much, and speaks well. He has told me he was very attachd to you. He loves you, as all the world does. J have charg'd him to pay to you my respects, and j hope the bearer of these will tell you with what tenderness i'll be for ever y r humble and faithfull servant Voltaire
