13 mars n. s. [1764] J have just now found in the general histori the passage concerning the statesman who is said to have kept two wives at home. J remember that an english gentleman told us that story some years ago at my house, in order to persuade us that two women, tho rivals, could live chearfully together under the care of a virtuous and amiable lord. Such a double wedding is contrary to our western laws, not to eastern, nor to the law of nature, and much less to good nature. If the report is false it shall be blotted out of a book cons√©crated to truth. 1
