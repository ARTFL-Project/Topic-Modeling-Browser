ar Sir, M rs Garrick & I intend ourselves the Pleasure of waiting upon m rs Hawkesworth & y o before we go into Staffordshire, & then we may further discourse upon y e subject of your last Letter. It is impossible for me to say how much y r Character of Zamti 1 may be rais'd by an Alteration from Voltaire: But as he stands at present he is greatly inferior to his Wife; his struggles about y r resigning of her, may give a strength & vanity that are at present wanted, for indeed I am not touch'd w th his proposals to Idame, as they stand in y e French Play. They are intended to be sublimely Heroical; but when Heroism is exerted at y e Expence of all y e other Passions, it becomes (in my opinion) very unfit for the Drama, notwithstanding the great fondness of y e French writers for it. I agree with you about Douglas 2 almost throughout. I have a doubt upon a few of y r Remarks. For these & Every thing Else, I am most sincerely Oblig'd to you & without y e usual Ceremony of finishing a Letter, am most faithfully y r Friend & wellwisher PS. I will send you a Line when I shall have a Day to Enjoy myself at Bromley. D. Garrick
