He has been indeed in y e Bastile but not upon y e account of any state affair; but for a particular quarrel w th a private Gentleman, and therefore I hope y r Grace will readily give him y r favour & protection in promoting y e subscription. I had not y e assurance when I took my leave of his Majesty to mention M r Tyrwight my chaplain to him for a benefice: a Gentleman of good birth, well affected to his Majesty's person, & Government, and a minister of good learning, of a pious & exemplary life suitable to his Profession, and if y r Grace will take an opportunity of recommending him to his Majty's favour for y e promise of some preferment, you will infinitely oblige My Lord y r Grace's most faithfull & most Obed t humble servant H. Walpole I had y e enclosed copy of news from Petersbourgh from b- 896, 430, 328, 524, 982, 602, 594, 1052, 772 -b .
