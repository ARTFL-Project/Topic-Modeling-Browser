. . . I hasten to acquaint you with my joy, my dear philosopher. Mme de Brenles presented me yesterday with a son. Up to the present everything goes on well for the mother and the child; but the first began so well and ended so sadly 1 . Such is the fate of our poor human race; our greatest pleasures are always mingled with some trouble. I ask your philosophical blessing for this child; he could not make his entry into the world under more favourable auspices. I have found for you a servant, whom I recommend; he comes from Lutry, one league from Lausanne, and belongs to very honest people. He understands the service very well; his last master, who is dead, was a wealthy financier of Paris, with whom he remained five years. He has excellent certificates from the different masters he has served. He would not fix the amount of the wages he expects; he proposes a trial of a few months, after which, if he pleases you, you can come to terms with him. Writing is not his strong point, but he is very ambitious, and flatters himself that at the end of a few months he will satisfy you on this point as on the others. All the information I have received is favourable to his trust worthiness, his mildness, and his discretion. He is thirty years of age. If you have any news about Mahon, I should be obliged if you would let me know. It is inconceivable how many fables have been written at Geneva. . . . Is is true that Colini has left you? I am sorry for it. It seems to me that this young man had merit, and that he suited you. . . .
