My dear friend: your new title, will change neither my sentiments, nor my expressions, my dear Fawkener a . Friendship is full of talk, but it b must be discreet. In the hurry of business you are in, remember only, j talk'd to you about seven years ago, of that very same ambassy . Remember j am the first man, who c did forestall the honour you enjoy. Believe then, no man is more pleas'd with it than j am. J have my share in y r happiness. If you pass through France, j advise you, j am but twenty leagues 1 from Calais, almost in the road to Paris, in Champaine; the castle is call'd, Cirey, four miles from Vassy d , on s t Disiers road, and eight miles from s t Dizier. The post goes thither. There lives a young lady, call'd the marquise du Chatelet , whom j have taught english, and who burns to see you. You will lye here, if you remember y r friend Voltaire. à Cirey à Vassy en Champagne ce 18 sept. nouvau stile 1735 Je n'ay apris que vous étiez nommé ambassadeur que par une gazette qui m'est tombée par hazard entre les mains 2 .
