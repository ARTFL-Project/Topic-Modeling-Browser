A Berlin , Seize Janvier [1753] Sr, Misfortune, good right and courage use few words, and apply themselves confidently to yr noble way of thinking. I dare send you this pacquet by a sure way, and I entreat you to send the letter 1 to Sr Evrard Fawkener when you will have perus'd it and sceal'd it with your sceal. If you can, if you will cause, the little paper 2 here enclos'd to appear in the gazettes, you will oblige a man, who, by his madness servant to a King, by his heart one of yr countrymen, by his sentiments worthy of yr favour, will never forget it. I am sure you will not let know I have writ to you. If I can wait upon you, I hope I would not appear altogether flat to your palate. Yr, with respect and gratitude, Voltaire
