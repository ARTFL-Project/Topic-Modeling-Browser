Berlin 3 b august n. s. [1751] S r , c- Chance directs all private and publik things. -c J receiv'd y. kind letter but yesterday, tho it was dated December. Y r letter expected me at Paris with y r book, and that book convey'd from Roterdam to Berlin d , was again sent to Paris by one of my friends, while j was rambling in the country, because at taht time, j was ready to make a journey to Paris. So by two mistakes, j had but yesterday, y r book and y r letter, and j return you many tanks for â€™em both. But j had already read y r curious history with much pleasure. The good patriot and the faithfull historian shine throug all the work. J hope you have met with the applause of y r country, and you stand in no need of foreign praises. J expose you my own satisfaction; rather than j attempt to compliment you. J can not sai good s r with what true sentiments of esteem j am sincerely from my heart, S r y r most humble obedient serv.
