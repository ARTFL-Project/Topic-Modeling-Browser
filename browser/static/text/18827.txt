Ferney , May 12th, 1771 Madame, The old man whom you have almost rendered young, thanks as much as he regrets you. I shall not fail to boast to her imperial majesty of a sermon 1 worthy of Plato the Grecian himself, presented me by one who is no less worthy to be the friend of Tomeris. Happy those, madam, who accompany you to Spa! — unhappy we who remain behind on the banks of the lake of Geneva! Our mountains will long resound to echo of your name — a name which will dwell for ever in my heart with admiration and respect. The old invalid of Ferney
