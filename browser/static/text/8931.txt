Madam, These three weeks almost j have no news at all from m r Berger. J am afraid he should be sick. Pray madam, send me by the coach of Bar sur Aube two copies of what has been printed already. You know you have promis'd me 72 copies fairly bound when the book 1 shall be printed. J must have besides a hundred copies sow'd at the price you will set upon; but j will pay for 'em. T'is a bargain j must absolutely make with you, j have no mind at all to be a burthen upon you, any way. Pray madam, is it true that the man j have Loaded with so many benefits, declaims against me? Write me a word about it. J must know the truth. J want sir Isac Neuton's optic 2 , translated by Coste, it sells at Paris. Send one by the same way, j mean, by the coach. J have receiv'd a letter from chevalier de Mouhi 3 . J have been unable to answer because j have been sick to death. Pray my services to him. I'll write to him as soon as j can. My services to y r father and husband. Pray answer without ado. V. Ã  Cirey ce 30 aoust [1736] par Vassy en Champagne
