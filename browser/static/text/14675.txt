Editorial comment : (He thanks him for his compliments.) I wish I had a house to offer you; I should have looked upon it as a favour if you were to accept it; I cannot be too near to you. I have followed my own tastes in doing my best to induce you to come to St Jean. In having thus obliged myself I owe you my gratitude. I do not think, sir, that Mme de Gallatin considers she has any claims upon you. She may have taken that view so long as those of M. Mallet were not asserted, but I can assure you that she no longer entertains any claim. It is true that there have been many matters for discussion, but everything is terminated in the manner which you would desire.
