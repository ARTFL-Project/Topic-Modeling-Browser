[16 February 1759] Sir, The letter with which you honour me does not permit me to doubt for an instant that you will conform, like your confr√®res , to the wise and peaceful views of the lords curators and of the sovereign council. The principal members of the state have placed at my disposal a copy of the libel which they caused to be seized at Lausanne. I consider it to be a defamatory and punishable libel, since it has been printed without the name of the bookseller and without permission, and attacks the reputation of several persons. I am in my right in instituting criminal proceedings against the publisher for having frequently mentioned my name in this libel, for having imputed to me works which I never composed, and for having lavished on me the most scurrilous insults and the most infamous calumnies. It is obvious that the aim of the miserable publisher of this insolent libel is to bring out, under cover of several pieces already printed, a new letter on Saurin, which letter the Mercure suisse wisely refused to insert. The question, sir, is not to know whether the minister Saurin, who died so long ago, merited the hangman's rope or not; but it is necessary not to endeavour to defame by every means an innocent family at present comprising eleven members; and the council of Berne will not permit it. You have too much reason, justice, and humanity to wish to defend a punishable libel printed by a scoundrel who is decreed at Geneva to be liable to arrest for a public theft. I hope that the sentiments of friendship will be joined to the pressing motives of religion, peace, honesty, and decency. I have the honour to be, &c.]
