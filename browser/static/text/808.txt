aux Délices, près de Genève 1 octobre 1755 Editorial comment : M. de Voltaire spends all the intervals between his illnesses in arranging his works. . . . The greater part of his fugitive pieces has been so much changed, and there are so many new ones in prose and in verse, that this new edition will be totally different from the others. He is constantly correcting his writings. He has even sent recently to M. d'Argental extensive changes in the tragedy of the Orphelin de la Chine . Lambert could perhaps print them as variants, at the end of his separate editions of this play. . . . The volume containing the Eléments de Newton has been much changed and abridged, because that which was new when the Eléments de Newton were first published is now known to everybody. . . .
