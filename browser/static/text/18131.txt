[c. 10 December 1750] a Sir, I return you with many thanks the gloomy but noble copy of verse 1 you was pleased to lend me for some days. I think a Muse would be better inspir'd in yr house than in a churchyard, and yr conversation would be more usefull to me than the prose and the poetry of all yr priests. Pray, Sir, do not forget me, when you write to my Lord Chesterfield and to Mr. Fox; and tell my Lord Chesterfield that King Frederic writes in another way than King James. He is not so great a Divine, but, by God, he is every way a better schollar. I am, with great longing to see you, Sr, Your most humble and obedient servant, Voltaire
