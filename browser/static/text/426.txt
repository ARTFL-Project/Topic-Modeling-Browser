Geneve b 10 May 1772 I take the liberty of sending you my translation of Tancred 1 . The favorable reception it met with from the public encourages me to hope, it is not altogether unworthy of its original, and I flatter myself you will look upon it with an indulgent eye, for I have ever observed that the noblest geniuses, are the most candid judges. The gentleman who will present you this letter is a modest sensible young man. I envy him the pleasure he must feel from seeing and conversing with you. I think the votaries c of the muses ought to flock from all parts of the world to Ferney to hail the poet and the sage. And as pilgrims of my own sex would not be wanting I should gladly embrace such an opportunity of assuring you in person with how much esteem I am sir your most sincere admirer and humble servant Dorothea Celesia
