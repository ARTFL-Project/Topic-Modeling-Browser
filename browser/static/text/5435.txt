[? January 1732] a Mylord, If the Swedish history which j took the liberty to send lately to y r grace proved a tedious offering, this friend of mine will not be so, and if my works have ever tired y r patience, j cannot make amends in a surer way than by presenting m r Tiriot to y r grace. He is my old friend, as found of England as j am and j envy him b the honour and the pleasure he shall enjoy to pay his court to the duke and the dutchess of Richemont. J must own my vanity has been so great with him as to make me boast often of y r protection. Pray mylord do not disown this boldness. Let me flatter myself that j am not quite out of y r mind. Let me improve this opportunity of showing y r grace that j'll be sensible all my life long of the favours you honour'd me with, and repeat to you and to mylady dutchess that j am with the highest sense of respect and gratitude mylord y r graces most humble obedient faithfull servant Voltaire
